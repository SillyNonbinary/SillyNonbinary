A SMALL INTRO TO ME WITHOUT NEEDING THE STRAWPAGE!!

-Heyo!! I’m Silly_Nonbinary also Know as Ebony, Silly, and Elliot. ANY NAME WORKS EVEN IF IT'S THE CHARACTER I AM ON PONY TOWN (Elliot is there mainly because he's the character I use the most. and I favorite Elliot)

-I like crowning ponies of characters I find cool or favorite. then again If you look cool and I see you I will crown you!!

-I mainly stay on the safe servers Mainly 1 now. But you may know me for sitting by APredictableNullity at the bakery or tree by the beach

- I'm not that chatty I will sit with you silently most the time or talk in whispers, if I have dni in my name you may still C+H me!! I'll just be quiet..!

- Games I have Main inteterst in right now: Regretevator, Forsaken, Dandy's world, Block Tales, Work At A Pizza Place, Dragon Adventures, FNAF, Pizza Game Beta, PUPI MIDNIGHT MUNCHIES [BIGGG INTEREST], and Evade.


- Long note for this: Uh please don't make self harm jokes or that type of stuff near me it makes me uncomfortable.
  I'm fine with small jokes but when it's all you say it makes me uneasy and most likely for me to not talk or reply to you, for very personal reasons. (This includes close friends as well please make sure it's obviously a joke)


-I don't like the fandom of some games..since some of them are toxic.

- I'm mainly afk on Ponytown one way to tell if I am is looking at my name, W2I is I'm online, I'm just watching something on another tab and I'll respond still, AFK is I'm fully away

- Pronouns: As seen on my page I go by They/Them, but honestly I don't mind what you call me I go by the pronouns of the character I play as

- Fun fact: I'm a cat person! I also like foxes. I personally Favorite orcas and Sharks right now

- Uhh I like some ships but I would say I enjoy PayCheck, [DOUBLEPIZZA/GLORYPIZZA], DoubleFedora, PizzaDebt, PAST Noob666, [DAISY1337], and like some Semi-Platonic PartyBeetle, Though not that much.,

- I don't speak about my ships Unless you ask, though I welcome any [Legal and non problematic ships..] except I dislike a few

- You will not see me being weird about shipping.

- I don't mind if you sit by me with a ship in your name that involves the character I am

ABOUT ME IN PONYTOWN

A SMALL INTRO TO ME WITHOUT NEEDING THE STRAWPAGE!!

-I'm a Minor. Please Interact with that in mind (As in a teen not like a child.), I like crowning ponies of characters I find cool or favorite. then again If you look cool and I see you I will crown you

-Heyo!! Iâ€™m Silly_Nonbinary also Know as Ebony, Silly, Elliot, and Non. ANY NAME WORKS EVEN IF IT'S THE CHARACTER I AM ON PONY TOWN (Elliot is there mainly because he's the character I use the most)

- Games I have Main inteterst in right now: Regretevator, Forsaken, Dandy's world, Block Tales[BIGGG INTEREST], Work At A Pizza Place, Dragon Adventures, FNAF, Pizza Game and Evade.


- Long note for this: Uh please don't make self harm jokes or that type of stuff near me it makes me uncomfortable.
  I'm fine with small jokes but when it's all you say it makes me uneasy and most likely for me to not talk or reply to you, for very personal reasons. (This includes close friends as well please make sure it's obviously a joke)


-I don't like the fandom of some games..since some of them are toxic.

- I'm mainly afk on Ponytown one way to tell if I am is looking at my name, W2I is I'm online, I'm just watching something on another tab and I'll respond still, AFK is I'm fully away

- Pronouns: As seen on my page I go by They/Them, but honestly I don't mind what you call me I go by the pronouns of the character I play as

- Fun fact: I'm a cat person! I also like foxes.

- Uhh I like some ships but I would say I enjoy PayCheck, DOUBLEPIZZA/GLORYPIZZA, DoubleFedora, PizzaDebt, Noob666, and like Semi-Platonic PartyBeetle.,

- I don't speak about my ships though I welcome almost any Legal and non problematic ship..

- You will not see me being weird about shipping.

- I don't mind if you sit by me with a ship in your name that involves the character I am

ABOUT ME IN PONYTOWN

A SMALL INTRO TO ME WITHOUT NEEDING THE STRAWPAGE!!

-Heyo!! Iâ€™m SillyNonbinary also Know as Ebony, Silly, and Non. ANY NAME WORKS EVEN IF IT'S THE CHARACTER I AM ON PONY TOWN

- Games I have Main inteterst in right now: Regretevator, Forsaken, Dandy's world, Block Tales[BIGGG INTEREST], Work At A Pizza Place, Dragon Adventures, FNAF, and Evade.

- Things I'm ok with you asking me are: For my roblox, what you should call me, and if we can be friends.

- I don't like the fandom of some games..since some of them are toxic.

- I'm mainly afk on Ponytown one way to tell if I am is looking at my name, W2I is I'm online, I'm just watching something and I'll respond still, AFK is I'm fully away

- Pronouns: As seen on my page I go by They/Them, but honestly I don't mind what you call me I go by the pronouns of the character I play as

- Fun fact: I'm a cat person, and my Roblox avatar is a cat!

- Uhh I like some ships but I would say I enjoy PayCheck, DoubleFedora, PizzaDebt, Noob666, and like Semi-Platonic PartyBeetle.
